ðŸ§  AI Algorithm

Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning:
Evaluates all possible moves in the game tree.
Uses Alpha-Beta pruning to eliminate branches that cannot improve the outcome.
Guarantees an optimal move, making the AI nearly unbeatable.


Algorithm Flow:

Generate all possible moves.
Evaluate terminal states (win, loss, draw).
Recursively simulate moves using Minimax.
Prune branches where possible using Alpha-Beta bounds.
Choose the best move for AI.


ðŸŽ¨ GUI Features

Interactive buttons for each cell.
Highlight the winning combination.
Restart button to play a new game.
